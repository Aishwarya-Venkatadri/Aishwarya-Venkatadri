Hey there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by my virtual resume.

## Who Am I?

Hi there! My name is Aishwarya. I love creating awesome websites, preventing online shenanigans, and turning creative ideas into impactful websites. I have experience in Risk Management and have worked with fraud prevention at Shopify and Amazon. Now, I'm on a mission to build a better web, one line of code at a time.
